**Logotherapist, trainer for non-violent communication, sports scientist**

**About me:** My training and experience have opened up new perspectives for me, which I pass on in counselling sessions, training courses and seminars. The connection between nature, movement and questions of meaning such as: ‘Who am I really and how do I want to live?’ is particularly important to me.

My vision is to take counselling and coaching out of traditional practice rooms and into nature. The diversity of the landscape - from rocky paths to hidden trails - reflects our own inner life and inspires me to show my clients new perspectives there too.

**My work is based on the following pillars:**

1. non-violent communication** according to Marshall Rosenberg: It shows me the importance of feelings and needs and helps to bring relationships to a deeper level.
2. **Logotherapy and Existential Analysis** according to Viktor Frankl: This approach promotes the appreciation of individual uniqueness, freedom and responsibility - with a special focus on the spiritual dimension, which offers strength and healing, as well as taking responsibility for each individual's life
3. **Sport and movement science:** My studies, sporting experiences, competitions and leading training groups characterise my work.
4. **Life experience:** I have had many experiences over the last twenty years with my husband and our three children. Our four-legged companions (horses and dogs) have also shown me many new ways of thinking.

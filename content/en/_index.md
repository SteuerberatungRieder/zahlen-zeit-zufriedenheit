# Numbers Time Happiness

**Manage sustainably AND live well with our consulting model for entrepreneurs**

Do you love your work, are the time you spend and the resources you use in good proportion to your earnings, and does the rest of your life run smoothly?
If you can answer yes to these questions, then congratulations!
However, if there are still a few issues here and there, or if none of this seems to be running properly, then we have a consulting model for you that will help you improve your situation step by step.

## Every journey begins with the first step

With us you learn

- to recognize connections and ingrained (thought) and behavioral patterns
- to consider their effects
- make conscious decisions
- define and implement suitable structures.

Taking lasting and sustainable new small steps will get you to your destination - because every journey begins with the first step.


## The consulting model applied in practice

### Numbers

are the basis for good decisions. The precise analysis of your key figures helps to improve your efficiency and effectiveness. Less effort with a good yield, less use of resources, but ecologically and fairly - this is how you operate sustainably.

### Time

Spending a lot of time does not necessarily lead to great returns or overall satisfaction. The amount of time spent is much more related to your efficiency and the working atmosphere. Is the cooperation respectful, are decisions made jointly, are the company's goals and strategy transparent and clear to everyone, is everyone pulling in the same direction? These are the decisive factors.

### Happiness  

What do you long for the most? Which of your needs are being neglected? What makes you happy? How should your working life / everyday working life be organized so that the quality of life suits you?  With our satisfaction factors, we will find out. After all, work is life (or do you feel “lifeless” during your work? Then it is high time for you to change)


### The soil on which everything flourishes

Do you approach your work with joy and trust? Do you cultivate togetherness, a culture of appreciation and compassion? Your inner attitude, your “mindset” can be recognized by your behaviour and actions. This is how you are measured.  Try it out: when you smile at the world, the world smiles back. Smiling is a very simple action, it happens when your inner attitude, your mindset is characterized by openness and kindness. And there is something you can be grateful for every day, right now, no matter how far along you are in the process. Because gratitude creates happiness. This is how to manage sustainably AND live well.
